### Stage Three - Ideation!

In this stage we did ideation for our museum app.

1. Each of the team member came up with at least 4 sketches.
2. We took ideas from each sketches and made an affinity diagram.
3. As a team, we compared and evaluated similar ideas and ditched the bad ones.
4. Chose 3 most promising ideas. Picked the best from those 3 and created a storyboard for that idea.
5. Developed a low fidelity prototype of the app using Balsamiq.

    We prototyped all user tasks **horizontally**.
    
    **Vertically** prototyped 3 major tasks.
6. Conducted Task-centered system cognitive walkthrough for the 3 major tasks.
7. Presented our prototype demo, and journeys throughout this stage.
8. Written report detailing this stage.
