## Project Stages
<details>
  <summary><b>Stage one</b></summary>
<br>
<p>We have decided on three possible project ideas:</p>
  <ul><li><b>A museum app</b></li>
  This app will display information for all artifacts and displays. It will accommodate things such as social distancing, people with visual impairment, and other ailments.  It will allow users to easily access information by the QR code/display displayed simply by taking an image. Allows for individuals to better their experiences in the museum as not having troubled by small quirks. Such as being in a place thatâ€™s too crowded to comfortably read the information, the text being too small or in a hard to read font, etc. It gives the user to customize how they receive the information. Implementing a QR reader/image recognition, to help identify what exhibit the user is pointing their camera at, through a mobile app.   
<li><b>A crime scene analysis tool</b></li>
    It is difficult to recreate a crime scene after it has been cleaned up. The tool provides opportunity for investigators to look back at details they may have missed and reduces the margin for human error. Reduces the chance of evidence being tampered with, and that in turn will lead to fewer wrongful convictions.  The software will create an AR recreation from a full scan of the original, untampered crime scene, which then allows investigators to look at the scene with fresh eyes and from different angles later. It will also allow users to examine and make notes on specific pieces of evidence that can be viewed in the AR environment. It will be implemented as computer software that allows the detectives to recreate and then examine the crime scene using images and dimensions. 
<li><b>A Fitness app</b></li>
    A fitness & dietary tracker to help a user track important aspect about their health, as well as ensure that the food they eat is within their dietary and caloric restrictions if they have any. This makes it convenient for users as everything to do with their health can easily be accessed in this app. Most trackers usually track one or the other, this app having it all in one package, will be very useful to the user.  It would be designed as a mobile app so that a user on the go can see if what they are buying in the store aligns with their dietary restrictions by simply scanning the nutrition facts, as well as tracking fitness data.  
 </ul>
